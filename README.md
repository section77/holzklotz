# holzklotz

I'm just a simple wooden thing that shows the current room status. If it's absolutely necessary I can change it too...

I have a RGB LED that shows my current thoughts:
- blue: oh noes, my old buddy WLAN is not around me.
- red: pretty lonely here completely without humans.
- green: wow, so many people, why won't anybody feed me with new code?

## Spaceapi
I also update my status to the space api and can be seen here for example https://mapall.space/heatmap//show.php?id=section77
